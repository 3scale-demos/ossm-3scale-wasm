# Notes for provisioning using RHPDS

## Provision cluster from catalog

Use [RHPDS](https://rhpds.redhat.com/) and select "OpenShift 4.7 Workshop (Small)" catalog item.

## Scale to 3 OpenShift nodes 

Go to MachineSets, if the third MachineSet is scaled to zero, scale it up so there are at least 3 worker nodes.
